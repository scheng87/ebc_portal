During the external evaluations, however, villagers and some government officials said that more children were going to school and had shoes, both of which relate to increased income. Changes in the form of new and improved houses, better clothing, and more cell phones and TVs were often mentioned [22]. Although the Programme was considered at least partly responsible for these perceptions, possibly because villagers now have greater control over the resources they use, there could be many other causes, such as the general improvement in the Tanzanian economy (economic growth rose by 4% in the 1990s to 6.7% in 2004 [25]) or the impacts of other donor-funded development projects such as the 1972_1991 Tanga Integrated Rural Development Programme (TIRDEP) funded by the then Federal Republic of Germany [26]. The monitoring results were insufficiently clear to demonstrate a direct positive effect of the CMAPs on fish catches and income"

The rural communities’é conserve the forest reserve, and gain legitimate access in return. This access consists of restricted user rights to the reserve with respect to the collection of firewood and Non-Wood Forest Products. INCOME GENERATING ACTIVITIES Income generating activities implemented as a part of the JFM scheme aim at substituting some forest products that the rural villagers are not allowed to take from the reserve. The activities on beekeeping and fish ponds are difficult to start as they are having a high entry cost as materials are needed. On the contrary, woodlots are common to most of the households and a good investment. MAIN FINDINGS The legitimate access to NDUFR has become stratified access. Stratified because different households are perceiving the legitimate access as either an obstacle or a possibility; and they make use of the forest reserve according to this perception. ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORITIES The households that perceive JFM as an obstacle are experiencing difficulties, when it comes to access to knowledge and access to authorities. Other households possess of social capital that facilitates their access to authorities and thereby also access to important knowledge about forest use and regulations."

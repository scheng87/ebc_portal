FEOWv1_TNC (FEOW version 1.1 slightly modified for The Nature Conservancy):

FEOW (Freshwater Ecoregions of the World) is the first-ever comprehensive map and database describing the world’s freshwater biodiversity. Covering all of the Earth’s 426 freshwater ecoregions, the FEOW map and associated species data are a powerful tool for freshwater conservation. A collaborative effort between WWF and The Nature Conservancy, the project brought together 200 leading freshwater scientists to create this extensive and easily searchable resource.

In its May 2008 issue, the scientific journal BioScience published an article that formally introduces FEOW to the conservation and scientific communities.  The article, authored by 28 experts from around the world, culminates 10 years of work mapping patterns of global freshwater biodiversity.

MODIFICATIONS:

The attributes table for FEOWv1 is slightly modified from the published version available on www.feow.org to include Major Habitat Types (MHTs).  Note that these MHTs have not undergone a comprehensive examination or rigorous review.  Also, FEOWv1 includes a field named "Old_ID", which may be helpful for joining attributes from draft versions of the FEOW including the work ending in May 2007 by TNC's Habitat Assessment Team for informing TNC's 2015 Goal setting processes.

Fields in the table are:

ECO_ID       : final ecoregion ID for public use
ECOREGION    : final ecoregion name (modified for simple characters and consistency)
MHT_TXT      : final major habitat type name
MHT_NO       : final major habitat type ID
Old_ID       : previous version of ecoregion ID (included for joining older tables)
ECO_ID_U     : final ecoregion ID for TNC use
